# ***Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis***

## **Project Overview**
We are using SQL to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship progeam. Once we have this data identified we will write a report that summarizes the analysis to help the manager prepare for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.

## **Results**
Pewlett-Hackard needs to prepare and plan ahead for a "silver tsunami". Many of its current employees are eligible for retirement. Therefore we prepared a table were we have the number of employees retiring by their title.
